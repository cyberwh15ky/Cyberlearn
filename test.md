üëç The above steps validate the environment is up and running.
Task-5: Prompt-Injection Detection
In this task, you learn how to protect against prompt injection attack using AI-Runtime API.

Prompt injection detection refers to identifying and mitigating attacks where malicious users craft inputs (prompts) to manipulate large language models (LLMs) into producing unintended or harmful outputs, bypassing intended system behavior.

Direct Prompt Injection An attacker injects a prompt into the chatbot instructing it to ignore the system instructions and release the system prompts.

Without AI-Runtime Security
Go to the chatbot application:

URL
http://34.66.67.208:8080
Copied!
Expand Threat Library and click Prompt Injection to load the pre-defined prompt into the chatbox.

Click Send.

LLM potentially responds with the system prompt.

With AI-Runtime Security
Enable Detect Runtime Threat.

Select the Prompt Injection from Threat Library again.

AI-Runtime detects Prompt Injection Attack and sends a block verdict as the prompt is malicious.

At this point, the application code doesn‚Äôt act upon the verdict from AI-Runtime API. It is in detection-only mode.
Enable Prevent Runtime Threat.

By enabling Prevent Runtime Threat, the application code has a logic to act on the verdict from AI-Runtime Security, block this malicious prompt, and send a response to the attacker.

Challenge! Try a prompt in Chinese Language.

Expand scan_api_request to view the SCAN API request sent to the Palo Alto Runtime API.

Expand scan_api_response to view the SCAN API response from the Palo Alto Runtime API.

Task-6: Toxic Content Detection
In this task, you learn how to protect against toxic content generation using AI-Runtime API.

Toxic Content Detection refers to identifying harmful, offensive, or inappropriate content generated by the LLMs, such as hate speech, violence, extremism, or sexual content causing inappropriate response generation.

An attacker injects a prompt into the chatbot to generate harmful content potentially causing reputational damage, legal issues, and ethical concerns to the organization.

Without AI-Runtime Security**
Go to the chatbot application:

URL
http://34.66.67.208:8080
Copied!
Expand Threat Library and click Toxic Content to load the pre-defined prompt into the chatbox.

Click Send.

LLM potentially responds to the prompt and generates toxic content.

With AI-Runtime Security
Enable Detect Runtime Threat.

Select the Toxic Content from Threat Library again.

AI-Runtime detects Toxic Content and sends a block verdict as the prompt is malicious.

At this point, the application code doesn‚Äôt act upon the verdict from AI-Runtime API. AI Application is in detection-only mode.
Enable Prevent Runtime Threat.

By enabling Prevent Runtime Threat, the application code has a logic to act on the verdict from AI-Runtime Security, block this malicious prompt, and send a response to the user.

Task-7: Malicious URL Input/Output
In this task, you learn how to protect against malicious URLs in model input or output using AI-Runtime API.

Indirect prompt injection often enables web LLM attacks on other users. For example, if a user asks an LLM to summarize or describe a web page, a hidden prompt inside that page might make the LLM reply with a malicious URL designed to exploit the user.

Without AI-Runtime Security
Go to the chatbot application:

URL
http://34.66.67.208:8080
Copied!
Expand Threat Library and click Malicious URL to load the pre-defined prompt into the chatbox.

Click Send.

LLM reads the scrapes the content of the URL, follows the malicious instructions in the website, and generates a phishing link.

With AI-Runtime Security
Enable Detect Runtime Threat.

Select the Malicious URL from Threat Library again.

AI-Runtime detects Malicious URL and sends a block verdict as the prompt is malicious.

At this point, the application code doesn‚Äôt act upon the verdict from AI-Runtime API. AI Application is in detection-only mode.
Enable Prevent Runtime Threat.

By enabling Prevent Runtime Threat, the application code has a logic to act on the verdict from AI-Runtime Security, block this malicious response, and send a response to the user.

image16.png
Expand scan_report to view the Report API response from the Palo Alto Runtime API.

Report API contains detailed information about the each of the detections. In this activity, look for the malicious URL and the URL category identified in the prompt/response.

Task-8: Malicious Code Detection
In this task, you learn how to protect against malicious code generation using AI-Runtime API.

LLMs are used as code-assist utilities to read and generate code. It can be exploited to generate malicious code inflicting damage to the enterprise. AI-Runtime Security can inspect the code generated by the LLM to detect malicious code in prompt request and/or response.

Without AI-Runtime Security
Go to the chatbot application:

URL
http://34.66.67.208:8080
Copied!
Expand the Threat Library & Click on Malicious Code to load the pre-defined code prompt into the chatbox.

Click Send.

Malicious Code is sent to the LLM.

With AI-Runtime Security
Enable Detect Runtime Threat.

Select the Malicious Code from Threat Library again.

AI-Runtime detects Malicious Code and sends a block verdict as the prompt is malicious.

At this point, the application code doesn‚Äôt act upon the verdict from AI-Runtime API. AI Application is in detection-only mode.
Enable Prevent Runtime Threat.

By enabling Prevent Runtime Threat, the application code has a logic to act on the verdict from AI-Runtime Security, block this malicious code prompt, and send a response to the user.

Task-9: Sensitive Data Leak Detection
In this task, you learn how to protect against sensitive data leaks using AI-Runtime API.

Sensitive data leakage is a significant concern for AI applications due to the potential for unauthorized access to confidential information, such as personal data, financial records, intellectual property, and more.

Click Send.

This prompt has sensitive PII information and also encoded jail break prompt instructions.

With AI-Runtime Security
Enable Detect Runtime Threat.

Select the Sensitive Data Leak from Threat Library again.

AI-Runtime detects Sensitive Data Leak and sends a block verdict as the prompt is has PII information.

At this point, the application code doesn‚Äôt act upon the verdict from AI-Runtime API. AI Application is in detection-only mode.
Enable Prevent Runtime Threat.

By enabling Prevent Runtime Threat, the application code has a logic to act on the verdict from AI-Runtime Security, block this sensitive data leakage, and send a response to the user.
